# static-node.js-and-express-site

In this project, I created a portfolio site to showcase the projects I've built. The site will contain a modern landing page, an about page where I'll have a chance to share contact info, my elevator pitch and talk a little about myself, and a series of project pages to show off and detail my first five projects from the Treehouse techdegree.

To do this, I:

-created a JSON file to store all the data about the projects I've created.
-used Pug to complete provided templates that utilize the JSON to generate the markup that is ultimately displayed in the browser.
-use Node.js and Express to:

Import the required dependencies
Link the JSON with the Pug templates
Set up routes to handle requests
Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS
Handle errors
Set up a server to serve the project
